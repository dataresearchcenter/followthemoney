- The [Popolo data standard](https://www.popoloproject.com/) developed by an alliance of open data activists is the foundation of _followthemoney_. It provides the origin of key entities, including {{ schema_ref('Person') }}, {{ schema_ref('Organization') }} and {{ schema_ref('Membership') }}.
- Popolo was then implemented by EveryPolitician.org, a MySociety project, establishing a practical reference.
- This was extended into [OCCRP Schema](https://github.com/occrp-attic/schema), a JSONSchema based entity model. The JSONSchema definitions were eventually superseded by a custom schema definition format to form FollowTheMoney.
- The evolution of FollowTheMoney (FtM) data model was driven by a grant of the [Google Digital News Initiative](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/) issued in 2016 for the development of the Aleph platform.
- [Dr. Amy Guy](http://rhiaro.co.uk/) took an essential role in breaking _followthemoney_ out of Aleph and introducing the current entity-based model.
